This is the list of plugins that I use daily with MPV, which make for an awesome experience :)

# What each does / Source

[Playlist Manager](https://github.com/jonniek/mpv-playlistmanager) - As the name suggests, helps you browse, make or manage a playlist  
[MPRIS](https://github.com/hoyon/mpv-mpris/) - A C-plugin which adds MPRIS capability for playback management from other applications or media keys  
[xrandr](https://gitlab.com/lvml/mpv-plugin-xrandr) - Makes mpv automatically invoke the "xrandr" tool to set the best suitable parameters for the display output
